# Additions

## Future Generation Pokemon

Many Pokemon from generations IV - VI can be now be caught in Hoenn. Likewise, pokemon from these generations will be sent out into battle by opponents.

## Storyline:

There is a new neighbor in Littleroot Town for you to meet. However, they are not at home.
People say she comes back every so often from her permanent residence at Omire Island.
Though the name is in your head this early on, and references to this place appear throughout your adventures,  
you will not come to visit Omire Island until after beating the Elite Four. 

#### Omire Island

To the south of Hoenn lies Omire Island. The markets there sell a myriad of items for adventure and home. 
The beach attracts trainers and vacationers alike, so you will be able to find hotels and vacation homes.

#### Route 135

Making your way East from Omire Island's main beach you will reach Route 135.

- more to come -
