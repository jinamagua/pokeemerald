# About
This mod aims to add post-game content like that of FireRed/LeafGreen, bring items back in a major way, and add QOL changes.  

The first changes will be noticeable as soon as you step off the truck at Littleroot Town, more townsfolk walk around and welcome the main character. Likewise, Routes 101-103 and Oldale Town will be buffed up.


The post-game content will unlock access to areas with buffed enemies and trainers.
